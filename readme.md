# MLE JavaScript Showcase

Oracle Database 23ai introduces [In-Database JavaScript](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/mlejs/) for Linux x86-64 and aarch64. Thatâ€™s Linux on Intel and Arm, respectively. Developers with a preference for Typescript can use it alternatively after transpilation to JavaScript. JavaScript support in Oracle Database is known as **Multilingual Engine**, or MLE for short.

This project is intended to be run via GitHub codespaces and showcase MLE/JavaScript features in a simple-to-set up environment.

Examples include:

- Writing custom JavaScript code
- Use of Typescript with MLE
- Integrating JavaScript code with APEX
